Effect of GeoVal structure generation parameters on Elastic properties
The variations in elastic properties with number of objects are shown below.
In the generated GeoVal structure the expected percentage of Porosity is 30% and ZrO2 is 30% and Al2O3 is 40%.
Keeping these constant percentages and number of RVEs to generate equal to 2, GeoVal structures are generated by introducing different number of objects in a voxel with dimension 32.

Note

The generated Geoval structure is having the percentage of porosity as specified but the percentage
of ZrO2 and Al2O3 is not maintained as specified. As a result identifying the pattern for the 
influence of number of introduced objects for a given dimension of RVE is not achieved.

GeoVal structures are generated with the expected percentage of Porosity = 30% and ZrO2 = 30% and Al2O3 = 40%
by introducing number of objects equal to 50 in a voxel with dimension of RVE equal to 32.
The variation in elastic properties with number of RVEs are shown below.

Note

The generated Geoval structure is having the percentage of porosity as specified but the percentage of ZrO2 and Al2O3 is not maintained as specified.

Effect of percentage (with a step 10) of Porosity on the elastic properties is shown below.
Percentage of ZrO2 is 10%, number of RVEs is 2, voxel dimension of the RVEs is 40 and number of particles in each RVE is 50.

Note

The target percentage of ZrO2 is not maintained in the generated structure and the
achieved maximum percentage of porosity introduced in the structure is ~33% .

Effect of voxel dimensions of the RVEs on the elastic properties is shown below.
Expected percentage of ZrO2 and Porosity is 30%, number of RVEs is 2 and number of
particles in each RVE is 30.

Note

The target percentage of ZrO2 is not maintained in the generated structure.
The outlier is because the generated ansys structure has 0% porosity for the case of voxel dimensions equal to 40 with number of RVEs = 1.

Note

Modification of the code for the generation of the GeoVal structures with controlled percentage of ZrO2
and Porosity will give good results for identifying dependence of properties on each parameters by keeping
remaining parameters as user specified. Also implementing measure of closeness to target percentage of
ZrO2 in addition to Porosity will reduce the simulation time by selecting the GeoVal structure close to the user specifications.
